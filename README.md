# NODE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

This little project shows you the sentiment analysis of an input you put into the command line.
You can put in normal strings or text files!

### Example with string:

terminal input:
node index.js nice hat you have there!

output:
This text is 43% positive, 0% negative and 56% neutral

### You can also use a txt file:

(textfile content in example: This is a test and I like that!)

terminal input:
node index.js test.txt

output:
This text is 35% positive, 0% negative and 64% neutral
